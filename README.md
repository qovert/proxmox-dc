## Prerequisites

### Proxmox Environment

- Proxmox VE cluster with sufficient resources
- Windows Server 2025 template properly configured (see [Template Preparation Guide](docs/template-preparation.md))
- Storage pool with adequate space (120GB+ per DC)
- Network bridge configured for domain controllers

### Ansible Setup

- Ansible >= 2.9 with required collections
- SSH access to Proxmox API
- Network connectivity to Proxmox hosts

### Network Requirements

- Dedicated network segment for domain controllers
- Static IP addresses reserved for DCs
- DNS forwarders configured
- Firewall rules for AD traffic

## Windows Server 2025 Template Preparation

Creating a proper Windows Server 2025 template is crucial for successful deployment. This template will be used for all domain controller VMs.

ðŸ“– **For detailed template preparation instructions, see [Template Preparation Guide](docs/template-preparation.md)**

### Quick Template Checklist

Before deployment, ensure your Windows Server 2025 template has:

- [ ] Windows Server 2025 Standard (Server Core recommended)
- [ ] Proxmox Guest Agent installed and configured  
- [ ] OpenSSH Server configured with key-based authentication
- [ ] PowerShell 7 installed
- [ ] CloudBase-Init installed and configured
- [ ] System properly sysprepped and converted to template
- [ ] Template tested with manual cloning

> **Important**: The template must be properly prepared with SSH access and CloudBase-Init for automation to work correctly.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/qovert/proxmox-dc.git
cd proxmox-dc

# Set up Ansible environment
./setup-ansible.sh
```

### 2. Generate SSH Key Pair

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair for the project
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/proxmox-ad -C "proxmox-ad-deployment"

# Add to SSH agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/proxmox-ad

# Copy public key content for configuration
cat ~/.ssh/proxmox-ad.pub
```

### 3. Configure Variables

```bash
# Edit main configuration
nano ansible/group_vars/all.yml

# Edit sensitive variables
nano ansible/group_vars/vault.yml

# Encrypt the vault file
ansible-vault encrypt ansible/group_vars/vault.yml
```

### 4. Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
# Full deployment (provision VMs + configure AD)
./deploy.sh

# Or step-by-step:
./deploy.sh provision   # Just create VMs
./deploy.sh configure   # Just configure AD
./deploy.sh validate    # Validate deployment
```

### 5. Cleanup (if needed)

```bash
# Remove all VMs and resources
./deploy.sh cleanup
```

## Architecture

This project uses **Ansible** for both infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.

### Deployment Flow

```text
1. VM Provisioning (Ansible)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Create VMs from template using proxmox_kvm module
   â”œâ”€â”€ Configure networking and storage
   â””â”€â”€ Start VMs and wait for SSH connectivity

2. Dynamic Inventory (Ansible)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Add VMs to Ansible inventory dynamically
   â””â”€â”€ Set up connection parameters and variables

3. Configuration (Ansible Roles)
   â”œâ”€â”€ windows_base: System preparation and hardening
   â”œâ”€â”€ active_directory: AD DS installation and forest creation
   â”œâ”€â”€ dns_server: DNS configuration with external scripts
   â””â”€â”€ monitoring: Health checks and performance monitoring

4. Validation (Ansible)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Verify services are running
   â”œâ”€â”€ Test AD connectivity
   â””â”€â”€ Generate deployment summary
```

### Key Benefits

- **Single Tool**: Use only Ansible for everything
- **Better Error Recovery**: Built-in retry mechanisms and rollback
- **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to re-run multiple times
- **Dynamic Inventory**: VMs automatically added during provisioning
- **Unified Debugging**: Consistent troubleshooting approach
- **Modular Design**: Reusable roles for different environments

### Enterprise-Grade Features

- **Professional Development**: Full PowerShell IDE support with IntelliSense
- **Production Ready**: Ansible-lint compliance and comprehensive error handling
- **Maintainable**: External scripts can be unit tested independently
- **Scalable**: Modular role-based architecture for different environments
- **Secure**: Modern SSH-based authentication instead of legacy WinRM

## Key Features of This Implementation

This project has been specifically designed to use **OpenSSH instead of WinRM** for secure remote management. This modern approach provides several advantages:

### Why OpenSSH Over WinRM?

- **Enhanced Security**: SSH key-based authentication is more secure than password-based WinRM
- **Industry Standard**: OpenSSH is the universal standard for secure remote access
- **Better Tooling**: Extensive ecosystem of SSH tools and libraries
- **Simplified Firewall**: Only requires port 22 (SSH) vs. port 5986 (WinRM HTTPS)
- **Cross-Platform**: Same tools work on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Better Debugging**: Standard SSH debugging tools and techniques

### Authentication Method

The project uses **SSH key-based authentication** for all remote operations:

- No passwords transmitted over the network
- Cryptographically secure authentication
- Easy to manage and rotate keys
- Supports automation and CI/CD pipelines

- PowerShell script logs: Check Windows Event Logs
- AD health reports: `C:\Scripts\Reports\`

### Useful Commands

```powershell
# Check AD services
Get-Service -Name NTDS, DNS, Netlogon, KDC

# Test AD replication
Get-ADReplicationPartnerMetadata -Target $env:COMPUTERNAME

# Check DNS
Resolve-DnsName -Name yourdomain.local -Type A

# Run health check manually
PowerShell.exe -File C:\Scripts\health-check.ps1
```

## Customization

### Adding Custom OUs

Modify the `organizational_units` variable:

```hcl
organizational_units = [
  "Servers",
  "Workstations",
  "Users",
  "Groups",
  "Service Accounts",
  "Custom OU 1",
  "Custom OU 2"
]
```

### Custom PowerShell Scripts

Add your scripts to the `scripts/` directory and reference them in the Ansible roles.

### Environment-Specific Settings

Use different `.tfvars` files for different environments:

- `development.tfvars`
- `staging.tfvars`
- `production.tfvars`
